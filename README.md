# DND
Creates a text-based DnD game through Bash scripting. The story will be updated over time to add more story.

- Will include a slightly simplified class system as opposed to the 5e rules at the start of implementation, but will later be updated to match the 5e classes better
- Levels will go 1-5 at the first iteration due to limited story. Later will be updated to 1-10, then 1-20. "DLC" versions will also be pushed for those that want to continue their journey along the way of updates. 
- I apologize in advance for the current lack of comments in the script. More comments will be added as the implementation grows, I wanted to just get something down that worked before going ham on 3 million comments

Known Issues:
- Due to lack of error checking, the ability score section allows the user to basically add ability points to whatever they want, even if it isn't on the list of abilities they can change.

Update (3/8/25)
- No changes today on the main branch, looking through the 5e spells/cantrips to decide what I'm going to provide. Considering allowing the user to just signify a type of build they'd want, allowing for preset spells and cantrips rather than picking and choosing, but not sure yet.

Upcoming
- After finishing weapon choice section, I will be adding a function to allow the user to type 'character sheet' at any time during the game and see a visual of their character sheet with important details. I will then finish off the character creation and finally add more comments to the script + add enhanced error checking across the board for better case handling.
