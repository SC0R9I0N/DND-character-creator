6/23/2025 - Complete documentation revamp

This project is an ongoing side project I have to make a Dungeons & Dragons character creator script. This is a Bash script that I plan to support printing out character sheets based on a specific level of your character. This will allow you to bypass having to print out a character sheet and write things into it. While I know this isn't a new thing, but I wanted to make this as a personal project for my own D&D campaigns as I like the idea of using my own software for my campaigns. It will walk you through the entire character creation process, including backstory, alighnment, and other things found when creating a character in D&D Beyond. 

Currently the script has a few bugs and is gagued towards the previous functionality of the program. Previously it was intended to be a full-fledged D&D campaign, but after extensive consideration, this felt like too large a project starting off. Therefore I made the decision to start with something small and make it just a simple character creator/manager so that players in a campaign can make notes on their own much easier and not have to always be scribbling and erasing on a printed out character sheet (since D&D Beyond has now become a subscription-based product for maps, I am also doing this in anticipation of there possibly being issues with character creation and management in the future.

Planned Functions
- Automatically calulate things such as HP, AC, dice rolls (to hit, saves, checks, etc.), proficiency bonuses, and anything else that needs calculations
- Saves data so that characters can be updated and you don't have to create a new character every time you want to make a change
- Add an option to print out only the new data (for example, if you add to lore or notes, you can choose to print out just those pages to save some paper)
